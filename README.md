## About This Repository

After many years of engineering with open source tools and technologies—ranging from PHP, Python, and Golang to AWS, TypeScript, React, Vue, and MySQL—I'm expanding my focus to include AI.

This repository tracks my progress through the Udemy course [**AI Agents & Workflows**](https://www.udemy.com/course/ai-agents-and-workflows/), which covers topics like prompt engineering and agent-based systems. It’s part of my continued effort to stay current with emerging technologies and understand how AI is reshaping software development.
